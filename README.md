This is my first Desktop App made using JavaFX in Eclipse IDE. 

This project was made for TV Companies to manage their employees, TV channels and the subscriptions easyly. Other than Java, this project also uses a database with the help of MySql. There, I made 2 tables, clients and tvchannels that are connected with a relation M:N using a third table, subscription using foreign keys.

In this app, you can view, add modify and delete clients/channels/subscriptions.

Hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š
